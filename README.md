# Simple-Text-Obfuscator
This script places your string of characters in a randomly generated string, making it very hard for someone to find it when they don't know what to look for.

**THIS IS NOT ENCRYPTION**

# How to use?

To obfuscate execute `py main.py` in console in the directory where main.py is located                                                                                      
Then write a string you need to obfuscate and press enter.                                                                                       
Then write the length of a nonsence string                                                                                       
**IT MUST BE A MULTIPLE OF 3**                                                                                       
After that a file which contains your obfuscated string `output.txt` will apear.                                                                                 

To deobfuscate execute `py decode.py` in console in the directory where decode.py is located.                                                                                    
Then write the name of txt file with an obfuscated string.                                                                                       
After that you will get your decoded word in the console.
