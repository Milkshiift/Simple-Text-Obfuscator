# Simple-Text-Obfuscator
Obfuscate and decode any string

# How to use?

**YOU NEED TO INSTALL PYTHON TO USE OBFUSCATOR**

To obfuscate write `python3 main.py` in console in main.py file directory                                                                                       
Then write word you need to obfuscate and press enter.                                                                                       
Then write length of obfuscated string                                                                                       
**IT MUST BE A MULTIPLE OF 3**                                                                                       
After that you get file named `output.txt` which contains your obfuscated word.                                                                                 

To decode write `python3 decode.py` in console in decode.py file directory                                                                                       
Then write name of txt file with obfuscated word.                                                                                       
After that you get your decoded word in console.
